/*
Declare int variable to track number of numbers per line
Begin loop iterating i 100 through 200
Check if i % 5 exclusive or i % 6 is 0, if so move to second if statement
Check if number per line tracker is less than or equal to 10. If so display with space, if not display with new line and reset tracker to 0
End loop

1. The program doesn't require any input from the user.
2. The program must display every number between 100 and 200 that is divisible by 5 or 6 but not both in lines of 10 where each number is separated by a single space.
3. The program must repeatedly divide every number between 100 and 200 by both 5 and 6, check if there is no remainder for both, and if there is no remainder for one but not both, display the number with appropiate String formatting.
4. The program must repeat the code that checks each number for its division result and displays them.
5. The program must have one short to store the number of numbers displayed in the String to only display 10 per line.
