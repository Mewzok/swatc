Prompt user for number
Assign number to int variable userInput
Send userInput to printMatrix method
Begin for loop for userInput length to begin displaying output vertically
Begin another for loop for userInput length to begin displaying output horizontally
Run random number generator and round output to 0 or 1 for each iteration
Display numbers for each iteration until end of second for loop
Add new line and repeat second for loop for each iteration until end of first for loop

1. The program could have an int to store the user's input.
2. The program technically only needs to display the effect of the user's input, stored in an int variable.
3. The program must check for valid input, a matrix less than 1 unit long or wide wouldn't function. The program must then perform several random number generations and rounding functions to display 0s and 1s.
4. The user input should be repeated to ensure valid input. The program must also repeat the displaying of the generated and rounded 0s and 1s both horizontally and vertically until the matrix length and width is reached.
5. The program requires the use of a "printMatrix" method, modularizing the code and keeping all calculations in one place, separate from the main method.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Exercise6_17 {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // declare variables
        int userInput = 0;

        Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

        // ensure input is greater than 0
        while (userInput < 1) {
            // prompt user and assign input
            System.out.print("Enter number for length and width of matrix: ");
            userInput = input.nextInt();

            // display warning if input is less than 1
            if (userInput < 1) {
                System.out.println("Number must be greater than 0.");
            }
        }

        // print matrix
        printMatrix(userInput);
    }

    public static void printMatrix(int n) {
        // print vertically
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {

            // print horizontally
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                System.out.print(Math.round(Math.random()) + " ");
            }

            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
