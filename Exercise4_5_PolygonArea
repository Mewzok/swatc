/*
Prompt user for input
Assign user input to number of sides and length of sides
Check valid entry of both number of sides and length of sides, if not terminate program or allow reentry.
Calculate area
Display area

1. The program must prompt the user for a number of sides and the length of those sides.
2. The program must display the area of the polygon the user created.
3. The program must first ensure the user input at least 3 sides and a length of over 0, then it must plug the user's input into the formula for determining the area of a regular polygon.
4. The program will need an int for the number of sides, a double for length and a double to store the area.
