/*
Prompt user for money deposited monthly and assign to double
Prompt user for annual interest rate and assign to float
Prompt user for number of months and assign to byte
Check months to ensure not a negative
Correct interest rate if entered a whole percent or a decimal
Calculate interest rate
Calculate total savings amount
Display total, format total to only two decimal places to represent dollars and cents

1. The program must prompt the user to enter an amount, the annual interest rate and the number of months.
2. The program must display the total amount of money in the savings account after the number of months entered.
3. The program must ensure the user enters valid input, then it must calculate the total amount in the savings account using the appropriate formula.
4. The program could use a double for the amount, a float for interest rate, a byte for number of months and a double for total savings.
